Plots odds ratios and discrete change coefficients from the
multinomial logit model.
------------------------------------------------------------

^Select variables^: select independent variables to include in plot

^Select amount of change^: amount of discrete change to plot for each variable
    ^+1^: unit change
    ^+SD^: standard deviation change
    ^0->1^: change from 0 to 1
    ^Don't plot^: exclude variable from plot
(Starting values for discrete change taken from output from ^prchange^, which
must be executed prior to executing ^mlogview^ if discrete change is to be
plotted.)

^DC Plot^: draw discrete change plot

^OR Plot^: draw odds ratio plot

^OR+DC Plot^: draw odds ratio plot in which the size of the letters
indicates the discrete change

^Next 6^: list next 6 independent variables for packed plot

^Note^: title for plot

^Number of tics^: # of tic marks on x axis of plot

^Plot from^: minimum and maximum values of x axis for plot

^Connect if^: for odds ratio plots, connect lines if not significant at
    specified level

^Base category^: value of category to use as base category for odds ratio plot

^Pack odds ratio plot^: eliminate extra vertical space in odds ratio plot

^Use variable labels^: use variable labels instead of names to identify
variables in plot

^Print^: send plot to printer
