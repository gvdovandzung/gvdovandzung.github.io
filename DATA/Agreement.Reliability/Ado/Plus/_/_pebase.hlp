    _pebase [if] [in] [, x(variables_and_values) rest(stat) all]

    where

    ^variables_and_values^ is an alternating list of variables and either
        numeric values or mean, median, min, max, upper, lower, previous

    ^stat^ is either mean, median, min, max, upper, lower, previous, zero, 
        grmean (group mean), grmedian, grmin, grmax


^_pebase^ is a utility command for programming commands that require the user
to set specific values for the independent variables in regression.

Values of the independent variables are set using the ^x()^, ^rest()^, and ^all^
options.  These can be passed directly from the user input for the 
programmer's command to ^_pebase^.

Options
-------

^x()^ sets the values of independent variables for calculating predicted
    values.  The list must alternate variable names and either numeric values
    or types of ^stat^.  

^rest()^ sets the independent variables not specified in x() to one of the 
    types of ^stat^.  Type ^help prstar^ for more details about using ^x()^ and
    ^rest^.

^all^ specifies that any calculations of means, medians, etc., should use
    the entire sample instead of the sample used to estimate the model.

Output of _pebase
-----------------

PE_base: global matrix containing set values of independent variables

r(pebase): r() class matrix containing set values of independent variables

r(nrhs): r() class macro containing number of independent variables

r(rhsnms): r() class macro containing names of independent variables

PE_base2, r(pebase2), r(nrhs2), r(rhsnms): same as above but for the 
    second equation of two-equation commands like ^zip^ and ^zinb^.
