^CASE CONTROL STUDY OF RISK FACTORS FOR HIV IN WOMEN, MWANZA TANZANIA^  
     
As part of a prospective study of the impact of STD control on the incidence
of HIV infection in Mwanza, Tanzania, a baseline survey of HIV prevalence was
carried out in 12 communities. All seropositive women (15 years and above)
were revisited and, where possible) interviewed about potential risk factors
for HIV infection using a standard questionnaire. In addition to interviewing
HIV +ve women, a random sample of HIV -ve women were selected from the
population lists prepared during the baseline survey and these women were also
revisited and, where possible, interviewed. No matching of controls with cases
was performed.
